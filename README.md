A very simple implementation of the Chip-8 Instruction-Set using Raylib and Odin

**ATTENTION:**  
This Projetc is NOT fully tested for memory safety etc, so there could be memory leaks I guess ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

## How to run
If you do not know Odin, this is how you run this "emulator":

1) [Get Odin](https://odin-lang.org/)
2) Run `odin build "./src/"` in the cloned directory
3) Run `./src.exe {rom-file}` to run the provided rom file

Thats it
